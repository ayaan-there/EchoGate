## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example Code Style:

```python
def extract_features(audio_file: str, sample_rate: int = 22050) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Extract audio features from an audio file.
    
    Args:
        audio_file: Path to the audio file
        sample_rate: Sample rate for processing
        
    Returns:
        Extracted feature vector
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If audio file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If audio file is corrupted
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test with different audio formats and qualities
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add docstrings to all new functions
- Update configuration documentation
- Include examples for new functionality
