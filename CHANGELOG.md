## Migration Guide

### From CLI to Web Interface
The system has been completely redesigned as a web application. CLI functionality has been deprecated in favor of the Streamlit interface:

**Before (CLI):**
```bash
python model_training.py --dataset data/ --model knn
python real_time_recognition.py --model models/best_model.pkl
```

**After (Web Interface):**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Configuration Changes
Configuration is now centralized in `config.py` and managed through the web interface.

### Model Format
Models are now saved in a standardized format with metadata:
- `models/best_model/` - Complete model bundle
- Includes model, scaler, PCA, and metadata
- Backward compatibility maintained
